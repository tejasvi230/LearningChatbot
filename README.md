# Learning-Chatbot

This project implements an interactive chatbot for an auto maintenance workshop. The chatbot is capable of answering common queries, learning new responses in real-time, and providing emergency contact information. It demonstrates various Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts including inheritance, polymorphism, composition, and templates.

## Features

- **Text-based user interface for interaction**
- **Predefined responses to common queries**
- **Real-time learning capability to add new responses**
- **File handling to store and retrieve learned responses**
- **Case-insensitive input handling**

### Key Features

1. **Predefined Responses**: Loads responses from a file.
2. **Real-time Learning**: Learns and saves new responses during runtime.
3. **Inheritance and Polymorphism**: Demonstrates class hierarchy and method overriding.
4. **Composition**: Integrates emergency services within the chatbot.
5. **File Handling**: Manages persistent storage of responses.

## Project Structure

- **Response**: Template class for storing keyword-response pairs.
- **Chatbot**: Base class for the chatbot functionality.
- **AutoMaintenanceChatbot**: Derived class adding auto maintenance-specific functionalities.
- **EmergencyService**: Class for providing emergency contact information.
- **WorkshopChatbot**: Derived class integrating emergency services.

## Files

- **main.cpp**: Main source file containing the implementation of the chatbot.
- **MJ-details.txt**: File containing predefined responses loaded by the chatbot.

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository**

```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-username/auto-maintenance-chatbot.git
cd auto-maintenance-chatbot
```

2. **Compile and Run**

```sh
g++ -o chatbot main.cpp
./chatbot
```

3. **Interacting with the Chatbot**

- Start the chatbot by running the compiled executable.
- Type your queries and press Enter.
- To exit, type `bye` or `exit`.
- If the chatbot doesn't understand a query, it will prompt you to teach it a new response.

## User Manual

### Greeting

When you start the chatbot, it will greet you and introduce itself.

```plaintext
Hello! Welcome to the Auto Maintenance Workshop. I'm MJ's Bot. How can I assist you today?
```

### Predefined Queries

The chatbot can respond to various predefined queries. Here are some examples:

- `services`
- `oil change`
- `tire rotation`
- `brake inspection`
- `engine diagnostics`
- `maintenance schedule`
- `appointment`
- `pricing`
- `location`
- `hours`
- `feedback`
- `thank you`
- `fluid check`
- `air filter replacement`
- `battery inspection`
- `tune-up`
- `alignment service`
- `vehicle inspection`
- `warranty information`

### Learning New Responses

If the chatbot doesn't recognize a query, it will ask you to teach it a new response.

```plaintext
I don't understand. Can you teach me a response for this?
Enter a keyword or phrase: [Your keyword]
Enter the response for this keyword or phrase: [Your response]
```
